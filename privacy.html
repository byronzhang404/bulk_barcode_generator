            <h5>4. LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
            <p>
              Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information
              described above will depend on the personal information concerned and
              the specific context in which we collect it.
              <br><br>
              However, we will normally collect personal information from you only
              (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with
              you; (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not
              overridden by your rights; or (iii) where we have your consent to do
              so. We have a legitimate interest in operating our Services and
              communicating with you as necessary to provide these Services, for
              example when responding to your queries, improving our platform,
              undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing
              illegal activities.
              <br><br>
              In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal
              information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to
              protect your vital interests or those of another person.
              <br><br>
              If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
              requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear
              at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your
              personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible
              consequences if you do not provide your personal information).

              employ a variety of security technologies and measures designed to
              protect information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The
              measures we use are designed to provide a level of security
              appropriate to the risk of processing your personal information.
              However, please bear in mind that the Internet cannot be guaranteed to
              be 100% secure.

            <h5>6. DATA RETENTION</h5>
            <p>
              We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an
              ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you
              with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal,
              tax, or accounting requirements).
              <br><br>
              When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
              personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if
              this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
              has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
              personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
              deletion is possible.
            </p>
      
            <h5>7. ACCESS</h5>
            <p>
              If you are a registered user, you may access certain information
              associated with your Account by logging into our Services or emailing
              hello@bulkbarcodegenerator.org If you terminate your Account, any public
              activity on your Account prior to deletion may remain stored on our
              servers and may remain accessible to the public.
              <br><br>
              To protect your privacy and security, we may also take reasonable
              steps to verify your identity before updating or removing your
              information. The information you provide us may be archived or stored
              periodically by us according to backup processes conducted in the
              ordinary course of business for disaster recovery purposes. Your
              ability to access and correct your information may be temporarily
              limited where access and correction could: inhibit BulkBarcodeGenerator's ability
              to comply with a legal obligation; inhibit BulkBarcodeGenerator's ability to
              investigate, make or defend legal claims; result in disclosure of
              personal information about a third party; or result in breach of a
              contract or disclosure of trade secrets or other proprietary business
              information belonging to BulkBarcodeGenerator or a third party.

                information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at
                any time. Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of
                any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it
                affect the processing of your personal information conducted in
                reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
              </li>
              <li>
